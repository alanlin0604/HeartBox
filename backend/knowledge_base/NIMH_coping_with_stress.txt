Summary of NIMH Guide to Coping with Stress

The National Institute of Mental Health provides the following guidance on understanding and managing stress:

1. Understanding Stress
- Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand — changes in environment, work, relationships, or major life events.
- Not all stress is bad — short-term stress can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best.
- Long-term (chronic) stress can harm your health: it can contribute to heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, and anxiety.
- Everyone experiences stress, but people respond to it in different ways.

2. Recognizing Signs of Stress
- Emotional signs: feeling irritable, anxious, overwhelmed, or sad.
- Physical signs: headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, trouble sleeping, or stomach problems.
- Behavioral signs: overeating or undereating, angry outbursts, substance use, or social withdrawal.
- Cognitive signs: difficulty concentrating, constant worrying, or racing thoughts.

3. Healthy Coping Strategies
- Take care of yourself: eat healthy, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and take breaks.
- Talk to others: share your problems and feelings with a parent, friend, counselor, doctor, or pastor.
- Avoid drugs and alcohol: these may seem to help in the short term, but they create additional problems and increase stress.
- Take a break: if a particular stressor is causing you anxiety, step away from it. Give yourself permission to take a break.
- Recognize when you need more help: if problems persist or you're thinking about suicide, talk to a mental health professional.

4. Stress Management Techniques
- Deep breathing exercises: breathe in slowly through your nose, hold briefly, then exhale slowly through your mouth.
- Progressive muscle relaxation: tense and then release different muscle groups throughout your body.
- Mindfulness and meditation: focus on the present moment without judgment.
- Physical activity: regular exercise reduces stress hormones and stimulates the production of endorphins.
- Time management: prioritize tasks and break large projects into smaller steps.

5. When to Seek Professional Help
- If you feel overwhelmed and unable to cope.
- If stress is affecting your work, relationships, or daily functioning.
- If you are using alcohol or drugs to cope.
- If you have thoughts of harming yourself or others.
- Contact a mental health professional, your primary care provider, or call a crisis helpline.
