Summary of NHS Mental Wellbeing Guide

The NHS recommends five evidence-based steps to improve mental health and well-being, based on research by the New Economics Foundation:

1. Connect with Other People
- Good relationships are important for mental well-being.
- Take time each day to be with your family — have a meal together, arrange a day out.
- Try switching off the TV and talking or playing a game instead.
- Visit a friend or family member who needs support or company.
- Volunteer at a local school, hospital, or community group.
- Make the most of technology to stay in touch with people you care about.
- Search for community activities in your area.

2. Be Physically Active
- Being active is great for your physical health and fitness, and evidence shows it can also improve your mental well-being.
- You do not have to go to the gym — take a walk, go cycling, or play a game of football.
- Find activities you enjoy and make them part of your life.
- The NHS recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.
- Even short bursts of activity (10 minutes at a time) count.

3. Learn New Skills
- Research shows that learning new skills can improve mental well-being.
- Try learning to cook something new, take on a new responsibility at work, or fix something at home.
- Sign up for a course — try a new hobby such as painting, writing, or music.
- Consider teaching yourself something new, like learning a language or a practical skill.
- Learning boosts self-confidence and helps build a sense of purpose.

4. Give to Others
- Acts of giving and kindness can improve your mental well-being.
- Small acts of kindness — a smile, a thank you, a kind word — go a long way.
- Volunteer your time for a cause you care about.
- Join a community group — helping others builds strong social bonds.
- Research suggests that acts of giving create positive feelings and a sense of reward.

5. Pay Attention to the Present Moment (Mindfulness)
- Paying more attention to the present moment can improve your mental well-being.
- This includes your thoughts, feelings, your body, and the world around you.
- Mindfulness can help you enjoy life more and understand yourself better.
- It can positively change the way you feel about life and how you approach challenges.
- Try to notice everyday things: the food you eat, the air as you walk, the sights and sounds around you.
- Set aside regular time for mindfulness practice — even a few minutes can make a difference.
