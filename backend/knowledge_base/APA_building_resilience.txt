Summary of APA Guide to Building Resilience

Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress. The APA identifies the following key strategies for building resilience:

1. Build Your Connections
- Prioritize relationships with empathetic and understanding people.
- Join a group — whether a civic organization, faith community, or support group.
- Helping others in their time of need can benefit both the helper and the recipient.

2. Foster Wellness
- Take care of your body: exercise regularly, eat well, get enough sleep, and stay hydrated.
- Practice mindfulness through journaling, yoga, meditation, or prayer.
- Avoid negative coping mechanisms such as substance use or excessive isolation.
- Keep your body and mind engaged through activities that promote well-being.

3. Find Purpose
- Help others through volunteering or community service.
- Be proactive — address problems head-on rather than avoiding them.
- Set realistic goals and work toward them consistently.
- Look for opportunities for self-discovery — people often learn something about themselves during difficult times.

4. Embrace Healthy Thoughts
- Keep things in perspective — avoid blowing events out of proportion.
- Accept that change is a natural part of life.
- Maintain a hopeful outlook and visualize positive outcomes.
- Learn from your past experiences — reflect on what helped you through previous challenges.

5. Seek Help When Needed
- Getting help when you need it is crucial to building resilience.
- A licensed psychologist can help develop strategies tailored to your situation.
- Focus on building a toolkit of strategies and skills to manage stress.

6. Key Facts About Resilience
- Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have — it involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed.
- The road to resilience involves considerable emotional distress — it is normal to struggle.
- Resilience is not about avoiding difficulty but about working through it with adaptive strategies.
- Cultural background, personal history, and individual preferences all influence how someone builds resilience.
