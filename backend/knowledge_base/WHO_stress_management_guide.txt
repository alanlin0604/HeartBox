Summary of WHO Stress Management Guide

This guide, developed by the WHO, provides practical skills for managing stress. It is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and is designed to be accessible to anyone experiencing stress, regardless of their circumstances.

1. Grounding Techniques
- When feeling overwhelmed, use the "feet on the floor" technique: notice the sensations in your feet touching the ground.
- Practice the 5-4-3-2-1 method: notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.
- Slow breathing: breathe in slowly for 4 counts, hold for 1 count, breathe out slowly for 6 counts. Repeat for several minutes.

2. Unhooking from Difficult Thoughts
- Notice when you are "hooked" by difficult thoughts or emotions.
- Name the thought: "I'm having the thought that..."
- Observe the thought without trying to push it away or act on it immediately.
- Recognize that thoughts are not facts — they are mental events that come and go.

3. Acting on Your Values
- Identify what truly matters to you (relationships, health, work, personal growth).
- Take small, meaningful actions aligned with your values, even during difficult times.
- Kindness toward yourself and others is a powerful antidote to stress.

4. Being Kind to Yourself
- Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a good friend.
- Acknowledge your suffering without judgment.
- Practice self-care: adequate rest, nutrition, and activities that bring joy.

5. Making Room for Difficult Emotions
- Instead of fighting or avoiding painful emotions, allow them to be present.
- Notice where you feel the emotion in your body.
- Breathe into that area and make space for the feeling.
- Emotions, like waves, rise and fall — they will pass.

6. Building Social Connections
- Reach out to people you trust when you need support.
- Offer help to others — acts of kindness benefit both the giver and the receiver.
- Even small social interactions can reduce feelings of isolation.
