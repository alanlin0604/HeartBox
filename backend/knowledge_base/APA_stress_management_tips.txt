Summary of APA Stress Management Tips

The American Psychological Association recommends the following evidence-based strategies for managing stress effectively:

1. Identify Your Stress Triggers
- Keep a journal to track what causes stress, how you feel, and how you respond.
- Recognize patterns in your stressors and reactions.
- Understanding your triggers is the first step toward managing them.

2. Build Strong Relationships
- Maintain connections with friends, family, and community members.
- Share your feelings with trusted individuals — talking about stress can help reduce its impact.
- Accept help when offered and offer support to others.

3. Walk Away When You're Angry
- Before reacting in anger, allow yourself to calm down.
- Take a walk, count to 10, or practice deep breathing.
- Respond thoughtfully rather than reacting impulsively.

4. Rest Your Mind
- Practice relaxation techniques: deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or tai chi.
- Schedule regular breaks during work to prevent burnout.
- Engage in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and relaxation.

5. Get Moving
- Regular physical activity is one of the most effective stress relievers.
- Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days.
- Even short walks can help reduce tension and improve mood.

6. Prioritize Sleep
- Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night.
- Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine.
- Limit screen time and caffeine before bed.

7. Eat Well
- A balanced diet supports both physical and mental health.
- Avoid using alcohol, tobacco, or other substances to cope with stress.
- Stay hydrated and eat regular meals.

8. Set Goals and Priorities
- Decide what must get done and what can wait.
- Learn to say "no" to tasks that create excessive stress.
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

9. Seek Professional Help When Needed
- If stress becomes overwhelming, talk to a licensed psychologist or mental health professional.
- Therapy can provide tools and strategies tailored to your situation.
- There is no shame in seeking help — it is a sign of strength.
